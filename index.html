       <h3 style="color:red"><b><i> Game Lab 9/15 Postmortem </b></i></h3>
      <p> After our first Game Lab meeting I realized that more planning should have gone into it. It was unorganized and rushed.
        With our Next Game Lab meeting we will drastically change the structure to be less learning and more doing. We made great
        progress developing our idea for Penguin Delivery System. I have posted a write up above (under announcements) about how to contribute to the 
        Penguin Delivery System Game. If you have questions message Dylan on Discord or Facebook. Before the next lab, We will 
        finish the JavaScript tuorial (with better detail and explinations). Our next meeting will tie JavaScript and Unity together
        and highlight why Unity 5.6.0F3 is important to develop on.
